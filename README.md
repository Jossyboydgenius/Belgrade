# Belgrade

Belgrade is a comprehensive cross-chain DeFi gaming platform with mobile verification capabilities. The platform seamlessly combines DeFi yield farming, blockchain gaming, and cross-chain functionality with a focus on security and enhanced user experience.

## About

Belgrade introduces a novel approach to DeFi and gaming by creating a seamless experience across multiple blockchains. It allows users to engage with DeFi protocols (primarily Aave), play blockchain-based games with provably fair outcomes, and verify transactions across chains. The project uses a sophisticated mobile verification system to enhance security and user experience.

## Problem Statement

Current DeFi and blockchain gaming platforms face several challenges:

1. **Limited Cross-Chain Functionality**: Most DeFi applications are restricted to a single blockchain, limiting liquidity and functionality.
2. **Poor User Experience**: Complex interfaces and technical knowledge requirements create significant barriers to entry.
3. **Security Concerns**: Centralized verification systems and lack of transparency in random outcomes create trust issues.
4. **Limited Gaming Integration**: Few platforms effectively combine DeFi yield opportunities with engaging gaming experiences.
5. **Mobile Access Limitations**: Most blockchain applications lack proper mobile support and verification capabilities.

## Solution

Belgrade addresses these challenges through:

1. **Cross-Chain Architecture**: Seamless interaction between multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Flare, Polkadot) using state connectors.
2. **DeFi Integration**: Direct integration with Aave for yield farming and liquidity provision.
3. **Provably Fair Gaming**: Implementation of Chainlink VRF for verifiable random outcomes in games.
4. **Mobile Verification**: A dedicated mobile verification system to enhance security and usability.
5. **NFT Rewards System**: Rank-based NFTs that track player achievements and provide additional benefits.
