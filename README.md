# DeGen

Mobile Money and web3 banking are mostly used everywhere, but here lies the case where most users are victims of scams(false transacryion of received amount, account draining, stolen account information). THis becomes hard as uses cant tell a gfake trasaction from a real one making it hard to protect themselves. At the same time, jumping into Web3 is complex, fragmented, and intimidating for the average user. There’s no smooth path from mobile banking to DeFi yield.

**DeGen** is a platform that bridges traditional mobile banking with decentralized finance (DeFi). It uses real-time transaction analysis, fraud detection, and Web3 integrations to help users understand, protect, and grow their money.

Users can convert their mobile banking or mobile money assets directly within the platform through our integration with **Bybit**, allowing them to seamlessly purchase **USDT** without leaving the app.

Once they’ve acquired USDT, users can:

- Participate in cross-chain lending and token swaps, accessing liquidity and earning yield across multiple blockchains
- Join Conditional Voting, where users vote on shared investment strategies and earn more yield (or take collective risk) depending on success
- Play in a fully on-chain Blackjack game, competing head-to-head with other users using USDT, with the winner taking the full pot

DeGen makes it easy to go from Web2 to Web3 without needing multiple apps or complex steps. It brings DeFi, gaming, and governance directly to users inside a secure, familiar, mobile-first environment.

**With DeGen, we bring Web3 directly to you.**
